Gullible's Travails (rewrite)


Goal: A fun, different roguelike, with a kind of existential approach!

The first version of GT was almost playable, but the code was a mess and too much was
hard-coded.

In this new version, I have switched to using data files, which makes things a lot nicer.

The game isn't really playable yet, but it generates a world and a dungeon, and you can walk
around. You can spawn monsters, but they don't do anything but walk around randomly. You can save and load.
See commands.c for keys.
