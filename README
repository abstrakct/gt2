Gullible's Travails (rewrite)


Goal: A fun, different roguelike, with a kind of existential approach!

The first version of GT was almost playable, but the code was a mess and too much was
hard-coded.

In this new version, I have switched to using data files, which makes things a lot nicer.
So far, there's not much more to the program than parsing the data file which defines the monsters.
